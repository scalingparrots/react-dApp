# [Deprecated] Template for Simple React Site ⚛

⚠️ **Important**: This template was originally based on `create-react-app`, which, according to the latest React guidelines, is now considered a less recommended approach for new projects. For modern and up-to-date projects, it's advised to consider using frameworks like Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, or others as outlined in the [official React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project).

In the project directory, you could run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency and copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies into the project.

## Recommended Modern Practices for React Projects

With the latest developments in the React ecosystem, starting new projects with more modern frameworks, better suited to current development and production needs, is advisable. Some recommended options include:

1. **Next.js**: A full-stack framework for React. Ideal for creating React apps of any size, from mainly static blogs to complex dynamic applications. Check out the [dApp Next.js Template](https://github.com/matteocelani/next-dApp) as an advanced starting point for building decentralized applications.

2. **Remix**: A full-stack framework with nested routing, perfect for developing React apps divided into nested parts that can load data in parallel and update in response to user actions.

3. **Gatsby**: A framework for fast CMS-backed websites with React, featuring a rich plugin ecosystem and a GraphQL data layer to streamline the integration of content, APIs, and services into a single website.

4. **Expo (for native apps)**: Enables the creation of universal Android, iOS, and web apps with truly native UIs using React Native.
